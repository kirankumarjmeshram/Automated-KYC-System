# Automated-KYC-System

## Purpose & Scope

The KYC (Know Your Customer) application automates identity verification by processing identity documents such as Aadhaar, PAN, and Passport. It utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Machine Learning (ML) for text extraction, document classification, and fraud detection. The system is designed for financial institutions, fintech companies, and NBFCs to streamline customer onboarding while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## System Architecture & Data Flow

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Frontend** - User interface for document upload and status tracking (React).
2. **Backend** - Handles API requests, processes OCR and ML tasks (Node.js/Python).
3. **OCR & ML Services** - External APIs for text extraction and classification (Google Vision API, AWS Textract).
4. **Database** - Secure cloud-based storage for user and verification data (MongoDB).
5. **Security Layer** - Implements encryption, authentication, and access control (JWT).

### Data Flow

1. **User uploads a document** (image/PDF).
2. **OCR API extracts text** from the document.
3. **ML model classifies the document type** (Aadhaar, PAN, etc.).
4. **Fraud detection module checks for tampering** using watermark and anomaly detection.
5. **Extracted data is validated** against user inputs.
6. **Verification results are stored securely** and returned to the user.

## API Endpoints & Integration Details

### Authentication

* `POST /auth/register` - User registration.
* `POST /auth/login` - User authentication (JWT-based).

### Document Processing

* `POST /kyc/upload` - Uploads document for verification.
* `GET /kyc/status/{id}` - Retrieves processing status.
* `POST /kyc/verify` - Validates extracted data against user input.

### External API Integrations

* **OCR API (Google Vision/AWS Textract)** - Text extraction.
* **Government APIs (Aadhaar/PAN Verification)** - Cross-checking user data.

## Security Measures & Compliance Adherence

* **Encryption** : AES-256 encryption for document storage.
* **Authentication & Access Control** : JWT for API access, role-based permissions.
* **Data Masking** : Aadhaar/PAN numbers are partially hidden before storage.
* **Regulatory Compliance** :
* **RBI KYC Guidelines** - Ensures legal onboarding practices.
* **GDPR Compliance** - User consent and data protection.

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure

* **Frontend** : Deployed on Vercel/Firebase.
* **Backend** : Hosted on AWS EC2/Google Cloud/Vercel.
* **Database** : Cloud-based MongoDB/PostgreSQL instance.
* **OCR & ML Models** : Runs on external APIs and cloud functions.

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Code pushed to GitHub/GitLab.**
2. **Automated testing & linting.**
3. **Deployment via Docker/Kubernetes (if required).**
4. **Monitoring with AWS CloudWatch/Datadog.**

## Conclusion

This KYC application provides a scalable, secure, and regulatory-compliant solution for identity verification. By integrating OCR, ML, and fraud detection, it enhances efficiency and reduces onboarding time for financial institutions.
