## Introduction to the Project

### Project Overview

Build an automated KYC system that processes identity documents (Aadhaar, PAN, Passport, etc.).

The system will use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from documents.

Document Classification will categorize documents (ID Proof, Address Proof, etc.).

### Project Goal

Automate KYC verification to reduce manual effort and speed up onboarding.

### Use Case

Banks, fintechs, and NBFCs need fast, accurate KYC verification.

## Key Features of the KYC System

### Core Functionalities

* **User uploads KYC documents** - Supports image and PDF formats.
* **OCR extracts text** - Reads details like Name, DOB, Address, ID number.
* **Document Classification** - Identifies document type (Aadhaar, PAN, etc.).
* **Fraud Detection** - Flags fake or tampered documents.
* **Data Validation** - Cross-checks extracted data with user input.
* **Secure Storage** - Stores verified data securely.

### Example Flow

1. User uploads Aadhaar
2. System extracts name, address
3. Confirms document type
4. Verifies authenticity

## OCR Module - How It Works

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Process

* **Preprocessing** - Converts image to grayscale, removes noise.
* **Text Extraction** - Detects and extracts text from the document.
* **Post-processing** - Formats extracted text into structured data.

#### Example:

*Aadhaar Card → OCR → {"Name": "Rahul Sharma", "DOB": "1990-05-12", "Address": "Delhi, India"}*

### Tools:

* **Tesseract OCR** (Open-source, works offline)
* **Google Vision API** (Cloud-based, high accuracy)

## Document Classification - How It Works

### Steps in Document Classification

* **Feature Extraction** - Detect logos, watermarks, and format structure.
* **ML Model Training** - Trains on labeled Aadhaar, PAN, Passport images.
* **Prediction & Labeling** - System predicts the type of uploaded document.

### Tools:

* **TensorFlow/Keras** - Deep Learning Model

## Data Validation & Fraud Detection

### Common KYC Fraud Cases & Solutions

| Fraud Type                | Detection Method            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Fake Documents            | Watermark/logo verification |
| Tampered Text             | AI-based anomaly detection  |
| Duplicate KYC Submissions | Hashing & cross-checking    |

### Verification Methods

* **Face Matching (Optional)** - Compares document photo with user selfie.
* **Cross-Check with Govt APIs** - Aadhaar/PAN verification via APIs.

## Project Task Breakdown

* **Frontend** - Upload UI, results display, progress tracking.
* **Backend** - OCR, classification, fraud detection APIs.
* **ML** - Train and test document classification models.
* **Database** - Secure data storage and retrieval.

## Security & Compliance Considerations

### Data Security & Regulations

* **Encryption** - Protects KYC documents during upload & storage.
* **Access Control** - Only authorized users can access KYC data.
* **Regulatory Compliance** - Adheres to RBI & GDPR guidelines.

#### Example:

* Aadhaar data must be masked before storing.
* JWT authentication ensures secure API access.

## Deployment & Testing

### How to Deploy the KYC Application?

* **Frontend:** Deployed on Vercel/Firebase
* **Backend:** Hosted on AWS EC2/Google Cloud/Vercel.
* **Database:** Secure cloud-based MongoDB/PostgreSQL instance.
* **OCR & ML Models:** Runs on Cloud Functions/Docker Containers.

### Testing Checklist

* Verify OCR accuracy with different document scans
* Test classification model on edge cases.
* Ensure secure API endpoints (JWT authentication).
